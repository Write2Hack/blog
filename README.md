## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `script/bootstrap`.

To test your theme, run `script/server` (or `bundle exec jekyll serve`) and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme and the contents. As you make modifications, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh.

See [this](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/) to see how to use this theme.
